## Usage

We tried our best to make the site as user friendly as possible, as such the UI is very easy to navigate.

* Enter a valid email address and valid phone number to sign in. Some US numbers require a +1 to be valid.

* Select a restaurant option.

* To add a food item to your card, click the "Add" button on the item. A check will appear for two seconds to let you know it's been selected.

* To go back to the main page from any restaurant. Click the Kachow Down Delivery logo in the top left.

* To go to the cart, click the cart button in the top right on restaurant pages, on the main page, it is in the main header.

* To remove an item from your cart, hit the trash can button on the right of the food item in the cart.

* To checkout, hit the checkout button in the cart.

* Fill in your name, and address information. Including the drop down selector for your nation.

* Fill in your payment information.

* If you would like to save all your information, click the Save Data checkbox. Your information will be autofilled on return.

* To finish checking out, click the checkout button.

* You will be redirected to a page thanking you for your purchase, then redirected to the main page. For when you're ultimately hungry again ;)

## Future Development Potential

These are all the unfinished, or optional items that could be done in the future.

* Option to have an item amount selector in the cart.

* Make a system for actual user accounts.

* Make a review carousel system.

* Add a geolocation api for easier address selection.

* Expand restaurant options, and food selections.
